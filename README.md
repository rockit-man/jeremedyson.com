This is a web-based exhibition of my skills as a full-stack web developer.
Built completely by me from scratch, this application serves as a demonstration
of the skills and knowledge I have gained since I began learning web development.

Here you will find my resumé as well as links to my repos, my online profiles,
and my social media presence. In addition to those things, I have made an extensive
effort in bringing accessibility to my page as this is one of my personal causes 
and an important aspect of the type of input I would like to bring to any and all 
front-end development that I'm responsible for building.
